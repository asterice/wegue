## About
Wegue (**We**b**G**IS with OpenLayers and V**ue**) combines the porwer of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the geospatial savvy of [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) to make lightweight webmapping applications. For styling and pre-defined UI-components the Material Design
Component Framework [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is used.

It acts as a template to reduce boilerplate work for browser-based mapping application.
